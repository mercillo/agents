Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources. Also, if you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations.

       "Reconciling the concepts of free will and determinism in a scenario where a person makes a choice that seems to contradict their past experiences and motivations is a complex philosophical issue. Here are some perspectives and considerations that could help in understanding this reconciliation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Understanding Free Will**: Free will suggests that individuals have the capacity to make choices that are not predetermined or dictated by prior states of the universe. This implies the ability to act according to one's own reasoning, desires, and intentions. \n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Determinism**: On the other hand, determinism holds that every event, including human actions, is determined by preceding events in accordance with the natural laws. This can suggest that past experiences, motivations, and even biological factors fully influence decisions.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Complexity of Human Experience**: Human behavior is influenced by a multitude of factors, including personal history, psychology, social context, and even neurobiology. A choice that appears contradictory could arise from new information, changed perspectives, or evolving values. People are not static; their motivations and desires can evolve over time, leading to choices that might initially seem inconsistent with their past experiences.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **The Role of Agency**: A reconciliatory view could emphasize that although choices may be influenced by prior motivations and experiences (determinism), the individual still possesses a degree of agency. This agency allows for reflection and reassessment of previously held beliefs in light of new insights, circumstances, or emotional states. \n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Emergence of Decision-Making**: Some perspectives propose a model of emergent decision-making where deterministic elements (like past influences) interact with human cognition and the capacity for introspection. This means while a person’s decision is influenced by their history, it can also incorporate rational thought and new motivations that lead to unexpected choices.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Existentialist Viewpoints**: Existentialism posits that individuals have the freedom to choose and define their essence through their actions, even in the face of societal and personal constraints. Under this lens, seemingly contradictory choices can be seen as expressions of personal freedom and authenticity, affirming one’s ability to transcend their past.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Cognitive Dissonance**: When people make choices that contradict their past motivations, cognitive dissonance may come into play. Individuals might experience internal conflict and discomfort when their actions don’t align with their self-image, prompting reflection and potential changes in beliefs or motivations over time.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Contextual Dynamics**: It can be valuable to consider the situational context surrounding a decision. A person's immediate environment, social pressures, or a significant life event might catalyze a choice that diverges from their historical behavior.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, reconciling free will and determinism in this scenario involves recognizing that while past experiences and motivations play a significant role in shaping choices, they do not completely negate the capacity for reflection, change, and the exercise of agency. An individual's capacity to choose can be viewed as an interplay between deterministic influences and free will, allowing for the possibility of choices that may seem contradictory at a glance but are part of a dynamic human experience."

Here are some perspectives and considerations that could help in understanding this reconciliation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understanding Free Will**: Free will suggests that individuals have the capacity to make choices that are not predetermined or dictated by prior states of the universe. This implies the ability to act according to one's own reasoning, desires, and intentions. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Determinism**: On the other hand, determinism holds that every event, including human actions, is determined by preceding events in accordance with the natural laws. This can suggest that past experiences, motivations, and even biological factors fully influence decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Complexity of Human Experience**: Human behavior is influenced by a multitude of factors, including personal history, psychology, social context, and even neurobiology. A choice that appears contradictory could arise from new information, changed perspectives, or evolving values. People are not static; their motivations and desires can evolve over time, leading to choices that might initially seem inconsistent with their past experiences.\n",
